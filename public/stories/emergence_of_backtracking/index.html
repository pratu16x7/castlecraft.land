<p>Say you’ve just sat down on the sofa, and you can’t find the remote.</p>
<p>[pic: sofa in hall]</p>
<p>What if you had a tiny bot that could make sounds, note words, move and scan things, could you tell it to find your remote?</p>

<p>Simple Rule 1:</p>
<p>So the bot can scan places, and check if the remote is there.</p>
<p>If found Beep. If not, it will just move on to a new place.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><code>&quot;move to a new place&quot; has a whole bunch of baggage. How will it? Is this the place to discuss it, or as we have done, some way ahead?</code></p>
<p><code>make algorithms as graphic as you can, they are pretty hard to parse and navigate.</code></p>
<p><code>may be a flow chart (perfect but too technical), but a moving one will help, or one along with a small animation in miniature that shows what it (bot/human) looks like following it</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Algo 1:</p>
<ol>
<li>go to a/next place</li>
<li>search if thing there</li>

<li>If Yes
<ol>
<li>Beep! and STOP</li>

</blockquote>
<p>You show this to the bot. and it does it&rsquo;s thing. After 5 min, it has found the remote. Not exceptional, but it was without any effort on your part, so yeah.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Yeah, the **steps -&gt; visual emergence** will be hard to avoid

whatever story explanantion you have to beget. It's the cleanest approach to understanding the essence of the solution

And to get to the steps, you need some intuitive simple rules, that take the form of:

what is needed/happened/problem -&gt; simple solution/what to do

- eg: can't search all at once -&gt; break down places to search
- eg: search all places / no searching twice -&gt; note down places to search, and mark them off
- eg: no searching twice -&gt; note down places you've been
- eg: if found -&gt; stop the search
- eg: if not found -&gt; go to the next place (in the list)

so in the end, it is **problem -&gt; intuition -&gt; steps -&gt; visual emergence/solution**

But, intuition doesn't happen in one go. It take trial and error, of keeping trying the simple steps we can come up with, until we have a bunch of simple steps that lead to a solution

<p>Not much time improvement: this doesn&rsquo;t stop the bot from actually <em>going</em> to that place.</p>
<h2 id="what-if-not-just-searching-again-stop-going-to-a-place-a-second-time-is-it-possible">What if: Not just <em>searching</em> again, stop <em>going</em> to a place a second time, Is it possible?</h2>
<p>For that, it not only has to search the place just once, it has to <em>go</em> to the place just once.</p>
<p><del>For that, It should have a organised way to search.</del> <code>Not very obvious, even though 80-90% of the way there</code></p>
<p>Any way we can look for areas in a way that ensures we go there only once?</p>
<p>Well, that depends on how we <em>choose</em> our <em>next</em> place to search. The next place itself should never be a place that we&rsquo;ve already visited.</p>
<p><code>Ooo, this getting terribly close to the singularity :P</code></p>
<p>And how are we currently doing that?</p>
<p><em>Randomly.</em></p>
<p>Eg: I scan, find table, search it. Then maybe I keep moving right, or check the next closest area, or anything like that.</p>
<p>We don&rsquo;t know if the next such place would be somewhere we&rsquo;ve already looked.</p>
<h3 id="trial-1-master-list">Trial 1: Master list</h3>
<p>One way that&rsquo;d be nice if we had a master list to know what are <em>all</em> the possible places to look. Looking by that list, we&rsquo;d be sure to visit every place once, because that place would show up on the list just once.</p>
<p>We could do that and sit down and make one &hellip; <code>But I want to make it automatically</code></p>
<p><code>I don't think we're going to be able to figure this one out. It'd be too mindblowing to be true.</code></p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do that and make one. How would we make that list anyway?</p>
<p>Well, it&rsquo;s not a tiny space</p>
<p>[the 2 rooms side by side pic]</p>
<p><code>visually, we'd look at it and go, &quot;Yeah let's just list down the hall places first and then the bedroom places.&quot; First step to breaking down the problem.</code></p>
<p><code>Near the mark, but not in the gold.</code></p>
<p>How can we be confident if we&rsquo;ve listed every area?</p>
<p>Humongous task, let&rsquo;s do in parts, and let&rsquo;s keep track of the parts &hellip; <code>Oh wait this is The Human way itself.</code>  <code>[&quot;break&quot; motivation]</code></p>
<p><code>Hmm, nope, can't get a line of though from here.</code></p>
<h3 id="trial-2-the-human-way">Trial 2: The Human way</h3>
<p>So okay, leave that. Let&rsquo;s step back a bit.</p>
<p>How&rsquo;d <em>you</em>, a human, go about it? Well you&rsquo;d not be perfect, you&rsquo;d think you&rsquo;re focusing on searching one area, which is true for a while, but then you&rsquo;d simply go search the closest place again, rather than taking the effort to move to the next <em>unsearched</em> place. And we don&rsquo;t even care.</p>
<p>Honestly, looking at the bot runs, the bot too seems to wind up at the same place more often, only ocasionally managing to break free of a closeted area, out of sheer random luck.</p>
<p>[gif: H+B view, with bot mostly searching in hall, and then breaking free and going into bedroom, only to come back</p>
<p>frames: nearly 10-12, with bot positions changing that&rsquo;s it]</p>
<p>The way you&rsquo;d most likely resolve this is, if you&rsquo;re serious enough to properly search the whole place, would be probably (a method I like to call) &ldquo;-&gt; (break (opt.),) choose, and finishing off -&gt; &ldquo;. <code>[&quot;break&quot; motivation]</code></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Simple Rule 3: [visual: break]</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t search everywhere at once. So before searching, break down a place into smaller parts, and pick one, and finish it off <em>completely</em> before moving on to next.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>[gif: breaking an area and zooming in, as a human, 2 passes]</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Isn't Break the same as creating artificial/organised opportunity to Choose, which we were going to do in an unorganised way anyway?
</code></pre><p>Optional, can be graphic: example flow in detail: among the bazillion places to look, you find your first opportunity to choose (and break) when &hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; you see Hall and Bedroom   <code>mmm, not mathematically convincing, but 95% of the way there. The full example does make some sense, as it is from real life experience.</code></p>
<p>You say,</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll search the bedroom first.&rdquo; And keep hall at the back of your mind</p>
<p>When you go to the bedroom, you again find two choices. You search the bed, and then move on to the study table &hellip;</p>
<p>where you find again, choices. 3 this time in fact and, in spirit of &ldquo;finishing off the table&rdquo; you look at all of them turn by turn before moving to any other place.</p>
<p>And now you see, just as all the places in the study table are finished, so are all the places in the bedroom.</p>
<p>That finishes off bedroom And then you move to the <!-- raw HTML omitted -->Hall<!-- raw HTML omitted --> to do the same thing.</p>
<p>The trouble now is, whose gonna tell the bot.</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p><code>You'll notice we've conveniently skipped the part of how we &quot;remember&quot; the next place to search</code></p>
<p><code>Easy to understand the first choice, the remaining choices need to be kept trakc of</code></p>
<p>Unlike us, the bot isn&rsquo;t very great with remembering, but it can take note.</p>
<p>In fact, it already has, taking note of every place once it goes there.</p>
<p>Now, it has to do the same, but before going to a place. It has to decide choices, note them and pick one, coming back to the others later.</p>
<p><code>This is a significantly different flow from earlier.</code></p>
<p><code>This will need ironing out the kink in the scan+note flow: when exactly does the bot do these things in the first flow vs second flow?</code></p>
<p><code>And now there is also the &quot;picking&quot; and &quot;striking&quot; off, something we weren't doing earlier.</code></p>
<p><code>our only way of striking out was, checking a list for the same place.</code></p>
<p><code>Remember: noting doesn't stop the bot from actually *going* to that place.</code></p>
<p>Let teach it to make a better list. We&rsquo;ll still cancel out and track, but in a much better way given our above experience.  <code>Not very convincing but okay.</code></p>
<p>Remember, Simple Rule 3: &ldquo;-&gt; (break (opt.),) choose, and finishing off -&gt; repeat -&gt;&rdquo;</p>

Human intervention could change that. Oh yeah, the non-erasibility is a good reason to write two paces ahead.

Or maybe, erasing is good and should be allowed
</code></pre><p>Let’s do this again, but let’s for draft sake, pick up where we left off, assuming we noted as per new rule of 2 steps ahead noting.</p>
<p>No remote on bed.</p>
<p>Cancels bed.</p>
<p>Moves to next choice above: Table</p>
<p>sees table top, drawer and cabinet</p>

<p>[-bedroom -bed]</p>

<p>… No remote in each, cancels each one by one</p>
<p>list complete: move two steps back and cancel Table.</p>
<p>Oh another list complete, cancel Bedroom.</p>
<p>And now, underline Hall, and enter.</p>
<p>Written, underlined, then cancelled. Everything just magically disappears :D</p>
<p>oh, so it was in the TV drawer. Who’d have thunk.</p>
<hr>
<p>But I suspect telling the bot to search for something like a cushion whould be easier, if it could compare the size of the space with the object to search.</p>
<p>We’d stop, But this would be a brilliant way to search out all those candy wrappers stuffed in unlikely places, by making the bot do a single pass over all the places once.</p>
<p>But what if we want to retrieve this solution again, how would we tell it to the bot?</p>

<p>The next day, you receive the interview call you’ve been anticipating, and they ask you to solve a puzzle.</p>
<p><em>“Place 4 queens on a 4x4 board in such a way that no two queens attack each other”</em></p>
<p>the solution would look like []</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t see how the technique we just learned help us here. Or can it??</p>
<p><strong>Turns out, <em>making choices</em> are relevant in far more areas of life/world then you thought.</strong></p>
<p>but we’ll have to wait for another time :)</p>
