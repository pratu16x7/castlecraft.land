### Hugo

- Home page content goes in root  _index.md, not index.md - Layout also goes in root, but is named index.md not _index.md
- Pre and other variables in menu items, pretty much anything you want - Wonder why do they also start with a dot like .Pre, same as page variables like .URL?
- Images need to be resourcified … Wrong! …  Anything in the static can have a normal path and it will be reachable in the end site.
- Even fonts. static reachable in css.

Tiny Styles

- paper back
- Jagged/straight border (pure css)
- randomized paper colors
- Pseudo-masonry Layout
