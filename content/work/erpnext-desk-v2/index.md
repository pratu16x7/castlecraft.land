Transforming the original iconic ERPNext desk to be a more complete  bird’s eye view of everything the full-open source ERP system has to  offer, all it’s modules and places therein. Also features a gamified  dependency tracking: the places and documents that require another prior activation of some other document(s) are notified to user on access.
