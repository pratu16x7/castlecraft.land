This was a general rewrite to forgo the legacy 9-step Setup Wizard  that the first-time users would have to go through even before getting a glimpse of what their newly registered instance looked like. The  first stage required only basic personal configuration, setting up with bootstrapped data to initialise the desk. The second would appear as an optional-but-essential wizard once inside, to enable users to import their own data, and guide them through a preliminary accounting flow.
