It was a book-perfect place in the verandah beyond the doorstep of your old little place in Lower Parel, listening to the stories you would tell us, making clay figures with  all the children there, and laughing at the little things you’d get  happy over. The little me would wonder what a single visit from us had  that you craved so much, no one else would get so very delighted. Time  went by and we were able to surprise more than you would surprise us.  Your awe over things coming alive that you had heard in tales, was a  reminder of all the wonder in things that we took for granted. We had  drifted apart slowly, with me being apparently too busy to spare time to visit often.

You recently suffered injuries that your body couldn’t mend by itself at  this age. Mother had become anxious, and I could only guess that  something was wrong. Every one of us came to you then. Your breathing  was irregular. You were even less conscious than last time. But we  selfishly wanted you to be with us, despite the all the pain you had to  bear.

The sun was setting, hope was beginning to fade.

But after a long while, you could see us and were normal, and the  obscurities of daily life again began to cloud in on me. I turned to  return, but on the way took a step back, wondering if there was a grave  possibility. And I went home to take care of other things, I was  relieved to learn after a while that mother was coming back for me as  well, being assured. I carried on in what I thought would be just  another weekday of the month.

But it wasn’t. I was wrong. Mother wasn’t returning. You weren’t able to make it.

I no longer knew what I was experiencing; whether I felt trapped in the  house or felt the night closing in. Thoughts were in a tumult. Running  all the way to catch a late night train alone, in a near-empty carriage, somehow I couldn’t care less. Walking the sparse streets to a place  where I had only ever gone before this day in anticipation of talks, now all there left was dread.

People outside were watching when I arrived, as I entered the building. More  looked up on reaching the flat, and I wanted to wait forever before  entering.
Everyone was there, but I couldn’t see them just yet. Your  beautiful form wasn’t moving. You almost looked asleep. The warmth had  left you, your touch was slack. I missed the sound of your voice. It was quite everywhere, all the outbursts must have subsided before I  reached. But I could see that staunch people had broken down that I had  never dreamt I would see. Like a coward, I envied my siblings who were  too far away. Tried to reassure myself and others it would be alright.

Those last duties to you had to be done, and you had to be taken away from  us. It was a long wait for them to return to us, whence we left for  home. As was custom to drench oneself for cleansing, it felt ironic  while being dehydrated. It all seemed like a dream, but there was no  waking. You wouldn’t be there to talk to on the phone anymore.

But in this age of criticism and complaining, I had seen everyone present  there for you, and felt what the previous generation had that we could  only aspire to imbibe; I saw what it really meant to be selfless;  helping, not thinking about yourself, not caring about the after-effects of doing what is right. People were, just good at heart.

I am thankful to you for staying with me until now, and lastly preparing a weak-hearted soul like myself for the feelings of loss; if thestrals  existed, I would be able to see them now. With grief as a purger of  feelings, I’m now able to assimilate all the pure happiness I never knew I had. I’m happy that your children got to be with you for so long in  the fabric of spacetime. But with no conceivable way of my present  future self to communicate with you, I shall always keep you in my  memories of the past.
