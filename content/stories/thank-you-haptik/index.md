- I have been exceptionally lucky, I got to work with people who are wonderful, and I got to do that while being silly. 

- learning fundamental things on how to work, how to learn. Work took a backseat, most of the times what mattered is how you did it.

- Like, I owe most of my personal growth and development in the past 1.5 year to the people here, Even the folk I haven't actually worked, and that's a gift that can't be forgotten
- Still, It feels weird thanking anyone, like it feels weird to thank your mom. Like you know she wouldn't have done otherwise. ~~She did the things she did because she's simple a caring person.~~ I could say though, that I'm quite fortunate to have gotten the opportunity, and I owe many of the ways in which I got to train my mind to them. They're examples of Trying to becoming a better person makes you a better problem solver.
- , you always AGF, prioritization is the only way to do the things you want to, Google sheets is the path to salvation.
- focus of 
- But yes. I would like to acknowledge couple of people though at this point, to who I owe the opportunity.
  - thank you Swapan and Saumil for the opportunity to work at Haptik itself
  - sorry to not have taken initiative, how able to coordinatate to manage you time, you at core kno but also its hard word, how much ever we might want to deny it.
- But yes everyone is constantly embodying the principles they learn and believe in, and I'll try to do the same, is to really live my learning here, and become a better haptikan at heart.

It's all about you, Haptik





- Honestly, haptik might have actually spoilt me. It's a very biased sample set of the real world, like on the being good end. Which can also mean that I have to yet actually reach the part where things get real. I'm kidding. I've just been able to have plain old fun.
- but the backgrounds do seem to be on the other, there are people from all over the place here. I mean all we need now
- 
- People are already thinking on a higher plan of existence. They've chosen their way to suffer, in the most creative or productive way.
- 
- I would like to take one person's name though, for very different reasons. It's just kind of acknowledgement. Madhan.
- Platform analytics, the doppelganger team at this point. But it is <still going strong>. Meet these people.
- I might have been too lucky to get to work with 
- 
- I think it all boild down to using Google sheets to solve your life, frankly.
- You learn that prioritization is the only way to do the things you care about.
- You learn that Google sheets are something you should use.
- We saw with Viraj since the most recent people embody what they are inspired by.
- You see people living the values they learn, so that's what I'm going and try to do. To be a better Haptikan at heart.
- sorry to not have taken initiative, you at core kno but also
- Trying to have a 1:1 with Swapan just turned into a game of "Let's get Swapan" I At that point I figured I might be just trying to impress someone I look up to, and not actually paying attention to them at all.
  - and also the aspect of having this amazing flag planting ability which basically screams "These 30 min of your are mine!" Theoretically you could back our but you usually don't, you're too kind.
- I'm sorry to have caused you any pain at any point in time. 

bura jo dekhan main chala bura na milya koi,

jo dil khoja aapna, mujhse bura na koi

- Wow this feels so safe, I might not even cry. he he he.



Thank you and Stay safe everyone :) See you



I recently came to know that Prats has a rather interesting meaning :D

Twenty one months is far too short a time to live among such excellent and admirable hob - folks, I mean. 



All the hard work and people doing it here is going to be an [inspiration]



I know too little about life to be sure about anything, the good or the "bad".

Noticed if I just try to be better individual, with small choices and nudges, doesn't matter what I do.



The Pandemic has already shown what I already knew deep down, the Earth is going to change a lot in my lifetime itself.



It was emanated by people I didn't even work with, I think that's the power it has had.



I've tried to piece together all my learnings, but it is going to be an ongoing process I think, as i will be reaching out time and again for guidance.



Sandesh: has spoilt me.

Jatin:

Priyanshi: confident, the-one, the first

Anas: hardest to surprise, won't be able to judge anyone, "Hmm, interesting" clear minded

Gopal: work life balance

Chirag: Fastest response times, while being productive. 

Saumil:

Shubham: Energy ball

Manish: has been a pillar, and a shield

Ronak: Hey you've 

Parvez: 

Swapan: 



Thank you for helping me learn



I'd be remiss if I didn't acknowledge the time that Haptik folk took me in :)

Tum se hi
